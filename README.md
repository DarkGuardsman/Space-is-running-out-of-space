# Hook

Space is running out of space.

Once long ago, you could look up into the night sky to see a galaxy of stars. A vast ocean of the milky way, the many planets, or even moon on a cloudless night. Now... the only thing that can be seen is a waste of junk. A sea of metal, a composite of ships and dying satellites. So dense that if it wasn't for the orbital mirrors and ship lanes the planet would have died.

In its own way, the junk fields could be a monument to the power of mankind and its journey into the stars. For those that do not have the luxury of traveling the stars its a curse. A mirror into the past and present of the destruction of the world.

For those that live in the orbital junk fields, we call it home. A place that exists filled with riches and outside the griefs of life on the planet. However, it's not without its problem.... we are running out of space. Junk is filling the void faster than it can be collected. Without a constant grind of drones, it will run out. 

# Game

"Space is running out of space" is a 2D top-down arcade game. The player pilots a drone to clear and collect junk in the orbital fields. The goal is to collect as much junk as possible. While at the same time prevent it from building up to crush nearby stations.
